== Description ==

*Next Active Directory Integration* allows WordPress to authenticate, authorize, create and update users against Microsoft Active Directory. *NADI* ist a complete rewrite of its predecessor Active Directory Integration and therefore an own plugin.

Even if *NADI* is available for free we hope you purchase a plan to let us continue the work on Next Active Directory Integration.

== Installation ==

= Requirements =
To install Next Active Directory Integration you need at least WordPress 5.6 and PHP 7.4

Although only tested with Apache 2.2 and 2.4 *NADI* should work with all other common web servers like nginx and IIS.

Next Active Directory Integration requires a few PHP modules to be enabled. Please verify in your `php.ini` that *ldap* and *openssl* are activated.

	; required by *NADI*
	extension=php_ldap.dll
	extension=php_openssl.dll

= Important =

As of *2021-12-09* NADI did *no* longer support PHP version *< 7.4*. The reason is that security support for PHP 7.3 and below has beeen dropped by the maintainers as you can see in the official PHP documentation http://php.net/supported-versions.php. 
For security reasons and in order to use NADI in 2022 we hereby politely encourage you to migrate your environments to at least PHP 7.4 until then.

Thank you all for your support and understanding.

Best regards,
your NADI team.

= Migration from ADI 1.x to NADI =
Please read [our migration guide](https://www.active-directory-wp.com/docs/Migration/index.html) carefully!

**NADI** can be easily installed from the [WordPress Plugin Directory](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins).

It is also possible to download the latest version from [https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/next-active-directory-integration.zip"](https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/next-active-directory-integration.zip) and unpack the folder to your *wordpress/wp-content/plugins* directory.

Developers can clone the [Git Repository](https://github.com/NeosIT/active-directory-integration2) inside their *wordpress/wp-content/plugins* directory and download the dependencies with *composer*.

= Single Site =
- Visit your WordPress blog and login into your WordPress dashboard as *Administrator*

- Activate the *Next Active Directory Integration* plug-in

= Network installation =
- Visit your WordPress network dashboard as *Super Admin*
- Click on the *Plugins* link in the left the navigation bar
- Activate the *Next Active Directory Integration* plug-in. In a WordPress network installation *NADI* should be *Network activated*.

You can enable/disable *NADI* for specific blogs by using the *Profiles* feature of *NADI*.
It is __not__ possible to activate *NADI* for a site inside a network.
